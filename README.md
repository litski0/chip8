# Recreating a Chip-8 Emulator in C++

This project is my implementation of a Chip-8 emulator in C++, created by working through a comprehensive guide. The goal was to take a hands-on approach to learning C++ and the fundamentals of how an emulator works.

The process involved studying the provided architecture, implementing the core logic, and debugging the system to ensure it ran correctly.

This project was a fantastic opportunity to learn about:
* The basics of emulation (CPU cycles, memory, registers).
* C++ function pointers.
* SDL library for graphics and keyboard input.
* Low-level concepts like bitwise operations on opcodes.
